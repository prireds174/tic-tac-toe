Breaking a Big Project Down

1. Wireframed how I wanted to layout of the page to be.
-Centered Board
-Display Reset Button Underneath Board
-Display 'Player's Turn' Top of Board
-Display Game Title Center Page

2. Things to solve
-How to alternate each boxes between 'x' 'o', respectively
-How to show a draw at the end of the game, if need be
-How to alternate between player 1/player 2 depending on turn
-How to not let squared be played on which have already been played
